## The Problem

You know your traffic. You don't know your money.

Google Analytics says Twitter is your #1 source. But that blog post from 6 months ago? It's quietly driving $40k/month. You just couldn't see it.

**The gap between visitor and customer is dark.**

## The Answer

Zori watches first touch. Remembers everything. Connects dots when Stripe speaks.

```
visitor arrives (utm_source=magic)
     ↓
zori remembers
     ↓
[... time passes ...]
     ↓
visitor → customer ($$$)
     ↓
"ah, magic brought money"
```

## What You Get
